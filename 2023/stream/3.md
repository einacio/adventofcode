Let's start something different, a stream of thought.

So, day 3 starts with the 2d problems, for now I'll just use the same read function.

Current idea is: have a second map with the same size, and on each element mark the number group.
And a list of the groups.

On the second pass, I identify the symbols and search groups around.

Previously I had functions created on a day by day basis. This year I'm creating a small library of helpers. 
This is specially useful for the map functions;

I didn't remember I can use destructuring in foreach (as in getAround);

I always hate how useless is summing arrays.

After much faffing around, we have correct test.

Yay, part 1 complete. It took a while (55min), but it looks like part 2 is just adding a second check on the inner loop :)

Yay, part 2 was quick, less than 10 min, being able to reuse most of the code. Pushing
